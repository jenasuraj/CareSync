The patients table is the foundational table that represents every user or patient registered in the system. This table exists to uniquely identify each patient and store their basic personal information. The primary key of this table is the id column, which uniquely distinguishes one patient from another and is used as a reference throughout the database. Alongside the id, the table contains columns such as name and potentially other demographic or profile-related attributes. This table does not store any activity or appointment-related data directly; instead, it acts as a stable identity source. Any table that needs to associate data with a patient, such as daily health tracking or appointment booking, does so by referencing patients.id. Because this table represents core identity, its data is relatively static and changes infrequently compared to transactional tables.
The doctors table represents all doctors available in the system and defines their professional identity and current operational state. Like the patients table, it uses an id column as its primary key, ensuring each doctor can be uniquely identified. The name column stores the doctor’s name, while the department column indicates the medical specialization or department the doctor belongs to, such as cardiology, orthopedics, or general medicine. The experience column captures the doctor’s professional experience, usually in years, and can be used for filtering or recommendation purposes. The most critical column in this table is the status column, which represents whether the doctor is currently available or unavailable for appointments. This column is not merely descriptive; it directly controls business logic. Any attempt to book an appointment must first consult this column to determine whether the doctor can be assigned to a patient. The doctors table therefore combines both descriptive information and real-time operational constraints.
The card table is dedicated entirely to daily health and activity tracking for patients and is one of the most important behavioral tables in the system. Each row in this table represents a single day’s activity summary for a specific patient. The table includes an id column, which uniquely identifies each card record, and a patient identifier that links the record back to the patient who performed the activities. The date column is crucial because it defines the day to which the activity data belongs; logically, for a given patient, there should be at most one card entry per date. The caloriesburnt column stores the number of calories the patient burned on that day through physical activity or exercise. The caloriesgained column stores the number of calories consumed by the patient on that same day through food or beverages. The exercise column stores descriptive or structured information about the type of exercise performed, such as walking, running, gym workouts, yoga, or any other physical activity.
The behavior of the card table is governed by a strict insert-or-update rule. When a user submits daily activity data, the system must first check whether a row already exists for that patient and that specific date. If a row already exists, the system must update the existing record instead of creating a new one. This ensures that daily data remains consolidated and avoids duplicate entries for the same day. If no row exists for that patient and date combination, the system inserts a new row, thereby creating a new daily activity record. Importantly, none of the activity-related columns are compulsory at all times. A user may choose to log only calories burnt, only exercise, or only calories gained, and the system should still accept and store this partial data. This design supports real-world usage patterns where users may not have complete information every day.
The appointment table is the transactional core of the appointment booking system and exists to model the interaction between patients and doctors. This table contains an id column as its primary key, which uniquely identifies each appointment. The p_id column is a foreign key that references patients.id and indicates which patient is booking or attending the appointment. The d_id column is a foreign key that references doctors.id and indicates which doctor the appointment is scheduled with. The date column specifies the date on which the appointment is intended to occur. Each row in this table represents exactly one appointment for one patient with one doctor on one date.
The logic associated with the appointment table is intentionally strict. When a user requests to book an appointment, the system must ensure that all three required inputs are present: the patient ID, the doctor ID, and the appointment date. Without any one of these, an appointment cannot be created. Before inserting a new row into the appointment table, the system must query the doctors table using the provided doctor ID and check the value of the status column. If the doctor’s status indicates availability, the appointment is considered valid and the row can be inserted. If the doctor’s status indicates unavailability, the appointment must not be created. This validation ensures that the appointment table always reflects real, actionable bookings and never contains logically invalid data.
Taken together, these tables form a clean and well-separated architecture. The patients and doctors tables define who the participants are, the card table defines what a patient does on a daily basis in terms of health and activity, and the appointment table defines when and with whom a patient interacts in a clinical context. Each table has a clear purpose, well-defined columns, and predictable behavior, making the system easy to reason about for both developers and intelligent agents performing retrieval-augmented reasoning.
